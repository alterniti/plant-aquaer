- we would support multiple moisture sensors
- many of the mounts and parts would be improved for easier assembly
- we would incorporate wireless connection 

- we would attempt longer-term testing, with tests over weeks or even longer 
- we would also gather more data to determine how long the soil takes to dry, and how much water we need for watering the plant
